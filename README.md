# React form validation

Hi! I'm Carolina, I am a web development student studying at SAIT (Souther Alberta Institute of Technology). This lab focuses on validation of a form using React and some node.js. I was able to successfully validate it using functions, useState and conditions. May come back to update this to do some finishing touches to reuse for later projects.

Feel free to test and play with it. I will provide instructions on how to download below
